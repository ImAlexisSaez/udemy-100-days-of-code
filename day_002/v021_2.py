"""
Instructions
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

Example Input
39
Example Output
3 + 9 = 12
12

Hint
Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
Think about type conversion.
